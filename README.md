<p>

For this assignment, We will develop and test a class for a simple C# console application (.NET Framework). The requirement for the application is that it allows a user to work with and modify the attributes associated with a rectangle.

</p>
<br>
<p>The Rectangle class should have two private integer attributes that hold the rectangle object's length and width. The Rectangle class should contain a default constructor, which sets the length and width each to the value of 1, and a non-default constructor, which sets the length and width to whatever the user inputs.

The Rectangle class must be public and contain six methods plus a default and non-default Constructor. The six methods are:
public int GetLength()
public int SetLength(int length) public int GetWidth()
public int SetWidth(int width) public int GetPerimeter() public int GetArea()


Each method should do the action as described by its method name. The SetLength method overwrites the old length with the new length. The SetWidth method overwrites the old width with the new width.

</p>
